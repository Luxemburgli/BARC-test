# Annotation Instructions

1. Go to the spreadsheet at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uPeAawNicITtLnT2aEclD5Ee-47gnfdXjuzugtfqceM/edit?gid=376627641#gid=376627641)
    - Fill out which file you want to work on
    - Grab the HTML file from Google Drive
2. Open the html file and annotate the problems
    - Rate the problems solely based on the input/output examples: Is it an ARC problem?
    - Rate the solution code: Does the transformation code/comments seem reasonable? (Redundant, mismatched, or overly complicated code is considered bad)
    - Upload the three files (Python, JSON, and PNG) to the repo under the synthetic_problems folder
